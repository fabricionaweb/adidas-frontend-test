# Front-End Test for Adidas

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run you need to install the dependencies (prefer yarn) first:  
`yarn install`

After that just start:  
`yarn start`

### Used

Since this is a small solution, I have used:

- [i18next-react](https://react.i18next.com/) for translation
- [Reach-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for forms
- [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) for validation
- [css-modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) for styles (native support from create-react-app)
- [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/) for consistent spaces
- [eslint airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react) for linting the code
- [jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing runner (native support from create-react-app)
- [react-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) for react-tests (native support from create-react-app)
